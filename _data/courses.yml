   url: https://columbiadb.github.io/
   details: "This course will survey modern research in data management â€“ from large scale data processing, modern database engines, to data cleaning and visualization, to secure data management. To ground the discussion, we will host invited speakers that have (or are) transitioned their research work from academia to industry. Depending on timing and interest, select students may be invited to join the speakers for more in-depth discussions over dinner after class."
 - name: "COMS E6998:  Interactive Data Exploration Systems"
   url: https://columbiaviz.github.io/2017s_e6998/
   details: Human beings rely on summarizing and visualizing data to make informed decisions. The number and volume of data continues to increase at exponential rates, and new user-facing systems and modalities are needed to handle the scale and heterogeneity of future data. This course surveys the landscape interactive data exploration systems along several axes.
